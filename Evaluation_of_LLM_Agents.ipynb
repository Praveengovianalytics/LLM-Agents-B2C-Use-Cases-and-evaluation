            "1. **Export and Import Costs**: A stronger US dollar can make US exports more expensive for foreign buyers, leading to lower demand for US products.

A stronger dollar can reduce the value of earnings generated in foreign currencies when converted back to US dollars, potentially impacting stock prices.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Competitive Position**: Exchange rate fluctuations can affect the competitive position of US companies relative to their foreign competitors. A stronger dollar can make imports cheaper for US consumers, potentially hurting domestic companies that compete with foreign products.\n",
